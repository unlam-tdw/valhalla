.SYNOPSIS
    One entry point for the quality gates: tests by layer, style checks, coverage.

.DESCRIPTION
    Wraps Maven so you ask for a gate instead of memorising lifecycle phases:

      .\scripts\gate.ps1 help                     every command, this text
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 list                     every class per layer, with counts
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 list UserServiceTest     the methods in one class
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 list=e2e                 one layer only
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 unit                     64 tests, no Spring context, no Docker
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 unit=UserServiceTest     one class
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 unit=UserServiceTest#shouldCreateUser
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 integration              56 MockMvc tests, in-memory HSQLDB
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 integration=AuthControllerTest
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 e2e                      all E2E, with the stack brought up
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 e2e=LoginViewE2E -Headed one E2E class
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 all                      everything, one `mvn verify`
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 all=UserServiceTest+LoginViewE2E
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 reset-db                 throws the local database away and rebuilds it
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 check                    Checkstyle, PMD, CPD, Prettier
      .\scripts\gate.ps1 coverage                 runs the suite, prints the coverage matrix

    Bare `.\scripts\gate.ps1` prints this help rather than starting a build.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\gate.ps1 unit -Fast
    .\scripts\gate.ps1 integration=SecurityConfigTest
    .\scripts\gate.ps1 e2e LoginViewE2E -Headed -SlowMo 300
    .\scripts\gate.ps1 all -Port 9090
    .\scripts\gate.ps1 check -Fix
    .\scripts\gate.ps1 list

.NOTES
    unit, integration and e2e are disjoint: `all` of them is the whole test suite.
    The split is by package, not by a new naming convention, so no test moves.

    Passing -Dtest to surefire replaces the <includes> in pom.xml, and with them the
    <excludes>**/e2e/**</excludes> that keeps E2E out of surefire. Every surefire gate
    here therefore re-states the e2e exclusion itself; forgetting it makes surefire run
    the E2E classes with no server and no database, which fails in ways that look like
    product bugs.

    `e2e` also states a -Dtest that matches nothing, because mvn verify always passes
    through surefire. `all` is the gate that runs the layers together.

    Arguments are parsed by hand rather than with a param block: PowerShell binds a bare
    positional like `unit` to the first positional parameter, which here takes a
    different type, and then fails to convert it.

Commands
  help                  this text (also -h, -?, --help)
  list                  the classes per layer, with test counts; list=unit|integration|e2e narrows it
  list <Class>           the methods in one class, fully qualified (both packages if the
                         name exists twice)
  unit                  every unit test              64 tests, no Spring context, no Docker
  unit=<target>         one class, or Class#method
  integration           every MockMvc integration   56 tests, in-memory HSQLDB, no Docker
  integration=<target>  one class, or Class#method
  e2e                   every E2E                   brings up PostgreSQL + Chromium;
  e2e=<target>          one class, or Class#method  unit and integration are skipped
  all                   unit + integration + e2e    one `mvn verify`, stack included
  all=<a>+<b>           a mix; + separates, e2e names go to failsafe, the rest to surefire
  check                 Checkstyle, PMD, CPD, Prettier. Changes nothing
  coverage              runs the whole suite, prints the coverage matrix
  reset-db              DESTROYS every local database and rebuilds it. See below

  No command means help. Nothing runs unless you name a layer.

Targets
  UserServiceTest                        a class
  UserServiceTest#shouldCreateUser       one method
  com.valhalla.integration.LoginControllerTest   fully qualified, when names collide
                                                (LoginControllerTest exists twice)

Options
  -Fast          skip Checkstyle/PMD/CPD/Prettier/JaCoCo (the -Pdev profile)
  -Fix           with `check`: let Prettier rewrite the files (check alone never does)
  -Headed        show the browser (e2e only)
  -SlowMo <ms>   per-action delay in the browser (e2e only)
  -Port <n>      moves Jetty and e2e.baseUrl together
  -Keep          leave PostgreSQL running afterwards

Examples
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 unit -Fast
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 unit=UserServiceTest
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 integration=AuthControllerTest#shouldRenderTheRegisterPage
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 e2e=LoginViewE2E -Headed -SlowMo 300
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 e2e -Keep
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 all -Port 9090
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 all=UserServiceTest+LoginViewE2E
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 check
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 check -Fix
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 coverage
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 list=e2e
  .\scripts\gate.ps1 reset-db

Coverage matrix
  unit, integration and all end with one: LINE, BRANCH and METHOD ratios per package,
  a TOTAL row, and the path to the html report. `coverage` prints the same table. A
  class or method target prints it too, scoped to what that run alone covered.

  It appears only when this run actually wrote the report. jacoco:report sits in the
  `test` phase after surefire, with no testFailureIgnore, so a failing run stops the
  build before the report is generated and the csv on disk is an older one; showing
  that would pass old numbers off as new. -Fast skips JaCoCo (jacoco.skip) and lands
  in the same place.

  `e2e` never prints one. The app under test runs in Jetty's JVM, which prepare-agent
  does not instrument, and surefire is starved with __NoUnitGate__, so an E2E run
  yields no coverage at all.

reset-db DESTROYS ALL LOCAL DATA
  JpaConfig sets hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update and there is no Flyway or Liquibase in the pom.
  `update` adds missing columns but never drops or renames one, so a renamed or removed column
  stays in the database: old rows keep it and land NULL in the new primary key, unreachable
  through the app, and the orphans pile up. The only local remedy is to throw the volume away
  and let Hibernate build the schema again -- which is what this command does. The data is
  expected to be lost; the stale schema is not.
'@

# Whole-file, not line-by-line, and anchored on `@Test` rather than with `@Test` optional:
# `@Test` sits on its own line above the declaration, so a per-line match also lists
# @BeforeEach helpers that no runner can execute. @Test\b keeps @ParameterizedTest and
# friends out.
#
# The gap between `@Test` and `void name(` is `[^;]*?`, and both of its ends are load
# bearing. `[^;{}]` looks safer and silently drops 27 of 136 methods, because Spring
# annotations carry braces: @WithMockUser(..., roles = { "ADMIN" }). A `;` is the honest
# stop, since it means the match has walked out of the declaration and into a statement.
